Hello!  This software was originally written with Java 1.6, and 
at the time it ran as an applet in the browser as long as you had
the Java 1.6 plugin installed.  The working web directory is still
there for anyone still running the 1.6 Java Plugin.

Today, Dec 12 2013, I have made a few small modifications to get the
program working with Java 1.7, and on my Mac OS-X, which it now does.
So, for version MFC-3.5 you should use Java 7, and launch the program 
from within the unzipped directory with the command: java -jar MFC.jar

The other option is to run the file MFC.py through the jython interpreter.
For this you can use jython-2.2.1.  I have not tested with other versions,
but jython-2.2.1 works with Java 1.7.  Launch like this: jython MFC.py
